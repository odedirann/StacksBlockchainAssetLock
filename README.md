# StacksBlockchainAssetLock

## Overview
StacksBlockchainAssetLock is a sophisticated asset lock system built on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging Clarity 2.0 smart contracts. The system allows users to securely store assets in "boxes" with complex conditions for asset release, including milestone-based releases, deadline-based expiration, multi-recipient allocations, emergency retrieval, and challenge mechanisms.

Key features include:
- **Milestone-based asset release**: Funds are locked and released upon the completion of predefined milestones.
- **Multi-recipient support**: Assets can be allocated to multiple recipients with proportional distributions.
- **Security and control mechanisms**: Includes administrative controls, emergency retrieval options, and challenge processes.
- **Transparency and auditability**: All asset movements and milestones are tracked and verifiable on-chain.

## Features

- **Asset Boxes**: Lock assets with specific milestones, and release funds upon milestone completion.
- **Multi-Recipient Boxes**: Distribute funds among multiple recipients with defined allocations.
- **Milestone Progress**: Track and verify milestone completion, ensuring funds are only released once the conditions are met.
- **Emergency Retrieval**: Allow for emergency recovery of funds if the depositor and admin confirm the situation.
- **Transaction Limits and Alerts**: Protect against large or frequent transactions that might indicate fraudulent activity.
- **Challenge Mechanism**: Enable participants to challenge any box operations with a stake.

## Smart Contract Functions

### 1. Asset Box Management
- **Create Asset Box**: Create a box where a depositor locks assets, defining the recipient, amount, and milestones.
- **Verify Milestone**: Release funds upon successful milestone verification.
- **Reclaim Expired Assets**: Reclaim assets after a box expires if certain conditions are met.
- **Cancel Asset Box**: Allow the depositor to cancel the box and reclaim remaining assets before completion.
- **Extend Box Deadline**: Extend the deadline of an asset box if needed.

### 2. Multi-Recipient Box
- **Create Multi-Recipient Box**: Create a shared asset box with proportional allocations for each beneficiary.

### 3. Administrative Controls
- **Verify Recipients**: Verify if a recipient is approved to receive assets from a box.
- **Control Delegation**: Delegate control over a box for actions like canceling, extending deadlines, or adding funds.

### 4. Security Features
- **Transaction Limits**: Monitor and enforce transaction limits to prevent excessive fund transfers.
- **Alerts**: Generate security alerts for suspicious activity on asset boxes.
- **Challenges**: Stake and challenge box operations, with mechanisms to resolve disputes.

## Setup

1. **Install Stacks CLI**: Ensure you have the Stacks CLI installed to interact with the blockchain and deploy the smart contract.
2. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the Clarity contract using the Stacks CLI, following standard deployment procedures.
3. **Interact with the Contract**: Use the provided functions to create asset boxes, assign recipients, and manage the contract's behavior.

## Example Usage

```clarity
(define-public (create-asset-box (recipient principal) (amount uint) (milestones (list 5 uint)))
  ;; Create a new asset box for storing funds with defined milestones
)

(define-public (verify-milestone (box-id uint))
  ;; Verify the completion of a milestone and release funds
)
